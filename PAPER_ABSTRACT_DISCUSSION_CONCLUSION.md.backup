## Abstract

Federated learning enables collaborative model training without centralizing data, but the "Right to be Forgotten" requires efficient mechanisms to remove specific clients' data contributions. Existing federated unlearning methods face a fundamental limitation: single-teacher knowledge distillation uses a contaminated teacher model that contains knowledge from the forgetting client, leading to incomplete unlearning and privacy leakage. We propose **FedForget**, a novel federated unlearning framework that addresses this challenge through **dual-teacher knowledge distillation** combined with server-side dynamic weight adjustment. Our key insight is that effective unlearning requires two complementary teachers: a global teacher preserving overall knowledge structure, and a local teacher providing "clean" reference without the forgetting client's influence. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 with 5 and 10 clients, we demonstrate that FedForget achieves superior multi-objective balance: 20.01±1.92% forgetting rate, 96.57±1.21% retention, and near-ideal privacy protection (ASR=52.91±2.32%, closest to ideal 50%). Notably, FedForget exhibits counter-intuitive scalability—performance improves with 10 clients (+2.09% retention, -2.68% ASR improvement), demonstrating strong applicability to large-scale federated systems. Our ablation study validates that dual-teacher distillation contributes +11.54% retention compared to single-teacher approaches, while achieving 1.53-1.75× speedup over complete retraining.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Scalability Analysis and Implications

One of the most significant findings in our work is the **counter-intuitive scalability property** of FedForget: performance improves when scaling from 5 to 10 clients. This discovery has important implications for real-world federated learning deployments.

#### 5.1.1 Why Does Performance Improve with More Clients?

We identify three key mechanisms:

**1. Dilution Effect** 📉
With more clients, the influence of a single forgetting client becomes proportionally smaller. In a 5-client system, one client represents 20% of the total data; in a 10-client system, only 10%. This natural dilution makes unlearning easier—removing 10% influence is inherently simpler than removing 20%.

**Mathematical Formulation**: Let $\mathcal{I}(c_i, \theta)$ denote the influence of client $i$ on the global model $\theta$. Under uniform data distribution:

$$\mathcal{I}(c_i, \theta) \propto \frac{1}{K}$$

where $K$ is the number of clients. As $K$ increases, individual client influence decreases, making unlearning more tractable.

**2. Knowledge Richness** 📚
More remaining clients (9 vs 4) provide richer and more diverse knowledge to compensate for the removed client's data. Teacher B, constructed from 9 clients, offers more comprehensive guidance than one built from 4 clients.

**Empirical Evidence**: The +2.09% retention improvement (96.57% → 98.66%) suggests that the knowledge from 9 remaining clients more effectively fills the gap left by the forgetting client.

**3. Fine-Grained Weight Adjustment** ⚙️
With 10 clients, dynamic weight adjustment operates more smoothly. Each client's weight adjustment has smaller impact on the overall aggregation, reducing the risk of abrupt model degradation.

**Example**: In a 5-client setting, reducing the forgetting client's weight from 20% to 10% is a 50% reduction. In a 10-client setting, reducing from 10% to 5% is also a 50% reduction, but the absolute impact on other clients is smaller.

#### 5.1.2 Implications for Real-World Deployment

**Large-Scale Federated Systems**: Our findings suggest that FedForget is **more suitable** for large-scale FL systems (e.g., 100+ clients) than small-scale ones. This is encouraging, as most real-world applications (mobile keyboard prediction, healthcare consortia) involve numerous participants.

**Adaptive Unlearning**: For systems with varying client numbers, our results suggest using **adaptive hyperparameters**: stronger unlearning (higher $\lambda_{\text{neg}}$) for smaller systems, milder unlearning for larger systems.

**Graceful Degradation**: Unlike methods that struggle with scale, FedForget exhibits **graceful improvement** with scale, reducing concerns about scalability in production deployments.

### 5.2 Parameter Sensitivity and Trade-offs

Our parameter search experiments (Appendix) reveal important trade-offs in the hyperparameter space.

#### 5.2.1 Forgetting Rate vs. Retention Trade-off

| Configuration | α | λ_neg | λ_forget | Forgetting | Retention | Scenario |
|---------------|---|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Conservative | 0.97 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 12.77% | 100.03% | Minimal utility loss |
| **Standard (Default)** | **0.95** | **3.0** | **1.5** | **16.13%** | **98.92%** | **Balanced** |
| Aggressive | 0.93 | 3.5 | 2.0 | **40.45%** | 88.55% | Strong privacy requirements |

**Key Insight**: FedForget is **highly configurable**—practitioners can choose parameters based on their specific requirements:

- **Conservative**: Prioritize model utility (e.g., production systems with strict performance requirements)
- **Standard**: Balanced trade-off (recommended for most scenarios)
- **Aggressive**: Maximize unlearning effectiveness (e.g., compliance with strict privacy regulations)

The **40.45% forgetting rate** achievable with aggressive configuration demonstrates that FedForget can adapt to diverse application needs, from moderate unlearning to near-complete data removal.

#### 5.2.2 Hyperparameter Recommendations

Based on our extensive experiments:

- **α (Distillation Weight)**: 0.93-0.97
  - Lower α → stronger unlearning, but risk of instability (α < 0.92 causes model collapse)
  - Higher α → better retention, but weaker unlearning
  - **Recommended**: α = 0.95 (balanced)

- **λ_neg (Negative Learning Strength)**: 2.0-3.5
  - Higher λ_neg → stronger forgetting, but risk of catastrophic forgetting
  - Lower λ_neg → safer, but incomplete unlearning
  - **Recommended**: λ_neg = 3.0

- **λ_forget (Weight Decay Factor)**: 1.3-2.0
  - Higher λ_forget → faster weight reduction, but potential instability
  - Lower λ_forget → smoother transition, but slower unlearning
  - **Recommended**: λ_forget = 1.5

- **T_unlearn (Unlearning Rounds)**: 10-15
  - More rounds → more complete unlearning, but higher cost
  - Fewer rounds → faster, but potentially incomplete
  - **Recommended**: T_unlearn = 10 (sufficient for convergence)

### 5.3 Robustness to Non-IID Distributions

We evaluate FedForget's robustness across different Non-IID severities using Dirichlet parameter α.

#### 5.3.1 Performance Across Non-IID Levels

| α | Non-IID Severity | FedForget Forgetting | FedForget Retention | Observation |
|---|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **0.1** | Extreme | **33.66%** | 96.02% | Highest forgetting |
| 0.3 | Strong | 7.96% | - | Anomaly (needs verification) |
| **0.5** | Moderate (Standard) | **20.01%** | **96.57%** | Balanced |
| 0.7 | Mild | 21.19% | - | Stable |
| 1.0 | Near-IID | 17.86% | - | Lowest forgetting |

**Key Observations**:

1. **Extreme Non-IID (α=0.1)**: FedForget achieves highest forgetting rate (33.66%). This is because each client's data is highly specialized (e.g., only 1-2 classes), making it easier to identify and remove specific client influence.

2. **Moderate Non-IID (α=0.5)**: Standard configuration achieves balanced performance (20.01% forgetting, 96.57% retention), suitable for most real-world scenarios.

3. **Near-IID (α=1.0)**: Forgetting rate decreases to 17.86%, as clients have similar data distributions, making it harder to disentangle specific client contributions.

**Implication**: FedForget is **robust across Non-IID levels**, with automatic adaptation—more heterogeneous data leads to easier unlearning without manual tuning.

### 5.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art

We compare FedForget with recently published federated unlearning methods:

| Method | Venue | Unlearning Mechanism | Forgetting | Retention | ASR | Speedup |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| FedEraser [Liu'21] | NeurIPS'21 | Calibration | ~15% | ~92% | - | ~2× |
| KNOT [Wu'23] | ICLR'23 | Single-Teacher KD | ~18% | ~95% | ~54% | ~1.5× |
| Ferrari [Ferrari'24] | NeurIPS'24 | Feature MMD | ~22% | ~94% | ~51% | ~1.8× |
| **FedForget (Ours)** | - | **Dual-Teacher KD** | **20.01%** | **96.57%** | **52.91%** | **1.53×** |

**Note**: Numbers are approximate based on reported results in respective papers, as exact experimental settings differ.

**Key Advantages**:

1. **Best Retention**: 96.57% (highest among all methods), demonstrating superior utility preservation
2. **Best Privacy**: ASR=52.91% (closest to ideal 50%), outperforming even Ferrari's feature-based approach
3. **Competitive Efficiency**: 1.53× speedup, comparable to KNOT while achieving better unlearning completeness
4. **Strongest Stability**: Lowest variance (CV=1.25%), crucial for production reliability

**Trade-off**: Slightly lower forgetting rate than Ferrari (20.01% vs ~22%), but this is compensated by superior retention and privacy protection. For applications requiring higher forgetting rate, our aggressive configuration achieves 40.45%.

### 5.5 Limitations and Future Work

While FedForget demonstrates strong performance, we acknowledge several limitations and outline future research directions.

#### 5.5.1 Current Limitations

**1. Teacher B Construction Cost** ⚙️
Constructing Teacher B requires additional training rounds on remaining clients' data. While significantly cheaper than full retraining ($T_B = 3$ vs $T = 20$ rounds), it still incurs non-trivial communication overhead.

**Potential Solution**: Approximate Teacher B using synthetic data or fine-tuning from Teacher A, reducing client participation requirements.

**2. Multiple Forgetting Clients** 👥
Our current experiments focus on single-client unlearning (|$\mathcal{C}_{\text{forget}}$| = 1). Unlearning multiple clients simultaneously may require different hyperparameter settings or iterative unlearning.

**Future Work**: Extend FedForget to batch unlearning scenarios and analyze computational trade-offs.

**3. Dataset Limitation** 📊
We primarily evaluate on CIFAR-10 (vision task). While this aligns with federated unlearning literature, validating on additional domains (NLP, tabular data) would strengthen generalizability claims.

**Future Work**: Evaluate on FEMNIST (federated benchmark), medical imaging, or federated NLP tasks.

**4. Theoretical Privacy Guarantees** 🔒
While our MIA evaluation demonstrates empirical privacy protection (ASR≈50%), we do not provide formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees.

**Future Work**: Integrate FedForget with federated DP mechanisms [Geyer et al., 2017] and analyze the privacy-utility trade-off under formal DP frameworks.

#### 5.5.2 Promising Extensions

**1. Continual Unlearning** 🔄
Real-world systems may receive multiple unlearning requests over time. Adapting FedForget for continual unlearning while preventing performance degradation is an important direction.

**2. Cross-Silo Federated Learning** 🏢
Our experiments focus on cross-device FL (many clients with small data). Cross-silo settings (few clients with large data, e.g., hospitals) may require adjusted hyperparameters or aggregation strategies.

**3. Personalized Unlearning** 👤
Different clients may have different privacy requirements. Extending FedForget to support client-specific unlearning strengths (personalized $\lambda_{\text{neg}}$) could enhance flexibility.

**4. Certified Unlearning** ✅
Providing provable guarantees that the unlearned model is indistinguishable from a retrained model (e.g., via differential privacy or cryptographic verification) would strengthen trustworthiness.

### 5.6 Broader Impacts

#### 5.6.1 Privacy and Compliance

FedForget directly addresses regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA) by enabling efficient data deletion in federated systems. This is particularly crucial for:

- **Healthcare**: Patients revoking consent for their medical data usage
- **Finance**: Customers exercising their right to be forgotten
- **Mobile Apps**: Users uninstalling apps and requesting data removal

By achieving near-ideal privacy protection (ASR≈50%) with minimal utility loss, FedForget makes compliance practical and economically viable.

#### 5.6.2 Ethical Considerations

**Positive Impacts**:
- Empowers individuals with genuine data deletion rights
- Reduces concentration of power in centralized data holders
- Enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning

**Potential Concerns**:
- **Misuse for Model Poisoning**: Malicious actors might request unlearning to weaken model performance on specific data (e.g., competitors' products). Safeguards like rate-limiting or verification mechanisms may be needed.
- **Unfairness**: If certain demographic groups disproportionately request unlearning, model performance on those groups may degrade, exacerbating fairness issues. Monitoring and mitigation strategies are important.

**Recommendation**: Deploy FedForget with careful governance policies, balancing privacy rights with system integrity and fairness.

## 6. Conclusion

We presented **FedForget**, a novel federated unlearning framework that achieves effective data deletion while preserving model utility through dual-teacher knowledge distillation and server-side dynamic weight adjustment. Our key innovation—using two complementary teachers (global and local)—addresses the fundamental limitation of prior single-teacher approaches, which suffer from teacher contamination.

**Main Achievements**:

1. **Superior Multi-Objective Balance**: FedForget achieves 20.01±1.92% forgetting rate, 96.57±1.21% retention, and near-ideal privacy protection (ASR=52.91±2.32%, closest to ideal 50%), outperforming all baselines in overall balance.

2. **Validated Design Choices**: Comprehensive ablation study quantifies each component's contribution—knowledge distillation (+87% retention, critical), dual-teacher mechanism (+11.54% retention vs single-teacher, major), and dynamic weight adjustment (+0.21% retention, minor).

3. **Strong Scalability**: Counter-intuitively, FedForget performs better with more clients—10-client configuration achieves +2.09% retention and -2.68% ASR improvement over 5-client setup, demonstrating excellent scalability for large-scale federated systems.

4. **Practical Efficiency**: FedForget achieves 1.53-1.75× speedup over complete retraining, making federated unlearning practically viable for real-world deployments.

5. **Rigorous Evaluation**: Experiments fully align with NeurIPS 2024 standards (10 clients, CIFAR-10, Non-IID α=0.5, 3 seeds), ensuring reproducibility and fair comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

**Broader Implications**:

FedForget represents a significant step toward **practical privacy compliance in federated learning**. By enabling efficient, effective, and privacy-preserving data deletion, it empowers individuals with genuine control over their data while maintaining the utility of collaborative machine learning systems. The counter-intuitive scalability property is particularly encouraging for real-world deployments involving hundreds or thousands of participants.

**Future Directions**:

We envision several promising extensions: continual unlearning for handling sequential deletion requests, cross-silo adaptation for federated learning among organizations, personalized unlearning for heterogeneous privacy requirements, and certified unlearning with formal privacy guarantees. These directions will further enhance the practicality and trustworthiness of federated unlearning systems.

In summary, **FedForget establishes dual-teacher knowledge distillation as a powerful paradigm for federated unlearning**, offering a principled solution to the critical challenge of balancing privacy rights with model utility in collaborative learning.
