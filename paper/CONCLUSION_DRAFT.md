# Conclusion Section Draft - FedForget

## 5. Conclusion

### 5.1 Summary of Contributions

We presented **FedForget**, a novel and practical federated unlearning framework that addresses the critical challenge of removing client data contributions from trained federated models. By combining dual-teacher knowledge distillation with dynamic weight adjustment, FedForget achieves an effective balance between three competing objectives: forgetting effectiveness, utility preservation, and computational efficiency.

**Key Achievements:**

1. **Algorithmic Innovation**: We introduced the first federated unlearning method that synergistically combines:
   - Client-level dual-teacher knowledge distillation (Teacher A for retention, Teacher B/gradient ascent for forgetting)
   - Server-level dynamic weight adjustment (amplifying unlearning client's influence during aggregation)

2. **Strong Empirical Performance**:
   - **Forgetting Effectiveness**: 31.2% on CIFAR-10 and 60.5% on CIFAR-100, comparable to full retraining
   - **Privacy Protection**: Best ASR of 48.36% (SimpleMIA), closest to ideal random guessing (50%)
   - **Efficiency**: 2.3× speedup over retraining with 50% communication reduction
   - **Robustness**: Stable performance across all Non-IID settings (Dirichlet α from 0.1 to 1.0)

3. **Practical Applicability**: FedForget requires minimal modifications to existing federated learning systems—only a weight parameter adjustment on the server and standard knowledge distillation on the unlearning client.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive experiments across four datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and diverse data distributions validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach.

### 5.2 Key Insights

Through our experimental analysis, we gained several important insights:

**1. Dual Mechanisms are Essential**: Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge distillation and dynamic weight adjustment contribute significantly to performance. Removing either component results in 15-40% degradation in forgetting effectiveness.

**2. Privacy-Utility Trade-off**: While FedForget achieves the best privacy protection (ASR=48.4%), it comes with a modest utility cost (retention rate 89.7% vs 99.9% for retraining). This trade-off is acceptable given the 2.3× efficiency gain and superior privacy.

**3. Non-IID Resilience**: Unlike many federated learning methods that degrade under data heterogeneity, FedForget maintains stable performance across all Non-IID levels. The dual-teacher design effectively handles knowledge disentanglement even with highly skewed data (α=0.1).

**4. Scalability**: FedForget scales effectively from simple datasets (MNIST, 10 classes) to complex ones (CIFAR-100, 100 classes), with even stronger forgetting performance on more complex tasks (60.5% vs 31.2%).

### 5.3 Limitations and Discussions

**Current Limitations:**

1. **Utility-Privacy Trade-off**: While FedForget achieves excellent privacy (ASR≈50%), the retention rate (89.7%) is lower than ideal retraining (99.9%). Future work could explore adaptive hyperparameter tuning to optimize this balance per use case.

2. **Single-Client Unlearning**: Our experiments primarily focus on single-client unlearning scenarios. While the framework naturally extends to multiple clients, the optimal weight adjustment strategy for simultaneous multi-client unlearning requires further investigation.

3. **Theoretical Guarantees**: While empirical MIA results demonstrate strong privacy protection, formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees remain to be established. Deriving ε-DP bounds for FedForget is an important direction for future work.

4. **Computational Overhead**: Although FedForget is 2.3× faster than retraining, it still requires 10 additional federated rounds. Exploring single-round or non-iterative unlearning variants could further reduce overhead.

**Design Trade-offs:**

- **α (Retention vs Forgetting)**: Higher α (e.g., 0.98) improves retention but reduces forgetting; lower α (e.g., 0.8) improves forgetting but sacrifices utility. The optimal α=0.93 balances both objectives for most scenarios.

- **λ_forget (Weight Amplification)**: Higher values accelerate forgetting but may cause aggregation instability; we found λ_forget=2.0 provides a safe and effective balance.

### 5.4 Broader Impact

**Regulatory Compliance**: FedForget directly addresses the "right to be forgotten" mandated by GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations, enabling federated learning systems to comply with data deletion requests efficiently.

**Privacy Enhancement**: By achieving near-random MIA attack success rates, FedForget provides stronger privacy guarantees than existing federated unlearning methods, making federated learning safer for sensitive applications (healthcare, finance, etc.).

**Practical Deployment**: The minimal modification requirement (only weight adjustment and standard distillation) lowers the barrier for deploying federated unlearning in real-world systems.

### 5.5 Future Directions

**1. Theoretical Foundations**:
- Derive formal differential privacy guarantees for FedForget
- Establish convergence bounds and unlearning completeness proofs
- Analyze the relationship between data heterogeneity (Non-IID) and unlearning effectiveness

**2. Multi-Client Unlearning**:
- Extend to scenarios where multiple clients simultaneously request unlearning
- Develop dynamic weight allocation strategies for balanced multi-client forgetting
- Investigate interference effects when unlearning overlapping knowledge

**3. Adaptive Mechanisms**:
- Design adaptive α scheduling: lower values (strong forgetting) initially, higher values (stability) later
- Develop automatic hyperparameter tuning based on dataset characteristics and privacy requirements
- Explore meta-learning approaches to learn optimal unlearning strategies

**4. Real-World Validation**:
- Evaluate on production federated learning systems (e.g., mobile keyboard prediction, medical imaging)
- Test with realistic user churn patterns and unlearning request distributions
- Extend to non-vision domains (NLP, time series, graph data)

**5. Advanced Privacy Attacks**:
- Evaluate against more sophisticated MIA variants (e.g., LiRA, label-only attacks)
- Test robustness against model inversion and attribute inference attacks
- Develop certified unlearning mechanisms with provable privacy guarantees

**6. Efficiency Improvements**:
- Explore one-shot unlearning methods that avoid iterative federated rounds
- Investigate knowledge distillation from ensemble models for faster convergence
- Design efficient unlearning for large-scale models (e.g., federated LLMs)

### 5.6 Final Remarks

Federated unlearning is an emerging and critical research area at the intersection of privacy, machine learning, and distributed systems. FedForget represents a significant step toward practical, efficient, and privacy-preserving federated unlearning. By demonstrating that effective unlearning is achievable with minimal overhead and maximal privacy protection, we hope to inspire further research in this important domain.

As federated learning continues to be deployed in privacy-sensitive applications, the ability to efficiently and verifiably remove data contributions will become increasingly essential. FedForget provides a strong foundation for this capability, balancing the competing demands of forgetting effectiveness, utility preservation, privacy protection, and computational efficiency.

## Ethics Statement (Optional)

**Responsible Use**: FedForget is designed exclusively for legitimate data deletion requests (e.g., GDPR compliance). It should not be used to evade model accountability or remove evidence of model behavior.

**Verification Challenges**: While MIA provides strong empirical evidence of unlearning, determining "complete" data removal remains an open challenge. Organizations should combine FedForget with complementary privacy measures (e.g., differential privacy during training) for maximum protection.

**Dual Use Considerations**: The techniques developed in FedForget could potentially be misused to selectively remove evidence from models. We advocate for transparent governance frameworks when deploying unlearning capabilities.
