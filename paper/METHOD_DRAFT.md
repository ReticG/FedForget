# Method Section Draft - FedForget

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

**Federated Learning Setup.** Consider a federated learning system with $N$ clients $\{C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_N\}$ and a central server $S$. Each client $C_i$ holds a local dataset $\mathcal{D}_i = \{(x_{ij}, y_{ij})\}_{j=1}^{n_i}$, where $x_{ij}$ is the input and $y_{ij}$ is the label. The global model $\theta_g$ is trained collaboratively without sharing raw data.

**Unlearning Request.** When client $C_u$ requests to remove its data contribution, the goal is to obtain a model $\theta_u$ that satisfies:

1. **Forgetting Effectiveness**: Performance on $\mathcal{D}_u$ should significantly degrade
2. **Utility Preservation**: Performance on remaining data $\mathcal{D}_{-u} = \bigcup_{i \neq u} \mathcal{D}_i$ should be maintained
3. **Efficiency**: Training cost should be much lower than retraining from scratch

**Challenges.** Unlike centralized unlearning, federated unlearning faces unique challenges:
- **Data Distribution**: Non-IID data makes knowledge disentanglement difficult
- **Communication Cost**: Limited by federated constraints
- **Privacy**: Cannot access other clients' data for verification

### 3.2 FedForget Framework

FedForget achieves efficient federated unlearning through a dual-level design:

**Server Level**: Dynamic weight adjustment during aggregation
**Client Level**: Dual-teacher knowledge distillation with gradient ascent

#### 3.2.1 Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation

For the unlearning client $C_u$, we maintain two teacher models:

- **Teacher A** ($\theta_A$): The pre-trained global model (fixed)
- **Teacher B** ($\theta_B$): The client's local model before unlearning (optional)

The student model $\theta_s$ (current client model) learns through:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{client}} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{pos}} + (1-\alpha) \lambda_{\text{neg}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{neg}}
$$

**Positive Learning** (Knowledge Retention):
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pos}} = \text{KL}(p_s(\cdot|x; \theta_s) \| p_A(\cdot|x; \theta_A))
$$

This preserves knowledge from other clients through distillation from the global model.

**Negative Learning** (Data Forgetting):

**Case 1**: With Teacher B (dual-teacher):
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{neg}} = \text{KL}(p_s(\cdot|x; \theta_s) \| p_B(\cdot|x; \theta_B))
$$

**Case 2**: Without Teacher B (gradient ascent):
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{neg}} = -\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(y, \theta_s)
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}$ is the cross-entropy loss.

**Hyperparameters**:
- $\alpha \in [0, 1]$: Balance between retention and forgetting
- $\lambda_{\text{neg}} > 0$: Strength of negative learning

**Algorithm 1**: Unlearning Client Training

```
Input: Student model θ_s, Teacher A θ_A, Teacher B θ_B (optional),
       Local data D_u, α, λ_neg, τ (temperature)
Output: Updated model θ_s

for each local epoch do
    for each batch (x, y) in D_u do
        // Positive distillation
        p_A ← softmax(f(x; θ_A) / τ)
        p_s ← softmax(f(x; θ_s) / τ)
        L_pos ← KL(p_s || p_A)

        // Negative learning
        if θ_B is available then
            p_B ← softmax(f(x; θ_B) / τ)
            L_neg ← KL(p_s || p_B)
        else
            L_neg ← -CrossEntropy(y, θ_s)
        end if

        // Combined loss
        L ← α * L_pos + (1-α) * λ_neg * L_neg

        // Update
        θ_s ← θ_s - η * ∇_θs L
    end for
end for
return θ_s
```

#### 3.2.2 Dynamic Weight Adjustment

During aggregation, FedForget adjusts the weight of the unlearning client to accelerate forgetting propagation.

**Standard FedAvg**:
$$
\theta_g^{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{n_i}{n_{\text{total}}} \theta_i^{t+1}
$$

**FedForget Aggregation**:
$$
\theta_g^{t+1} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{forget}} \cdot n_u \cdot \theta_u^{t+1} + \sum_{i \neq u} n_i \cdot \theta_i^{t+1}}{\lambda_{\text{forget}} \cdot n_u + \sum_{i \neq u} n_i}
$$

where:
- $\lambda_{\text{forget}} > 1$: Weight amplification factor for unlearning client
- $n_i$: Number of samples in client $i$

**Intuition**: By increasing the unlearning client's weight, the server accelerates the propagation of the "forgotten" knowledge across the global model.

**Dynamic Adjustment**: We gradually reduce $\lambda_{\text{forget}}$ over rounds:
$$
\lambda_{\text{forget}}(t) = 1 + (\lambda_0 - 1) \cdot e^{-\beta t}
$$

This ensures stable convergence while maintaining forgetting effectiveness.

**Algorithm 2**: FedForget Server Aggregation

```
Input: Client models {θ_1, ..., θ_N}, sample counts {n_1, ..., n_N},
       unlearning client ID u, λ_forget, current round t
Output: Aggregated model θ_g

// Compute total weight
total_weight ← λ_forget * n_u + Σ_{i≠u} n_i

// Weighted aggregation
θ_g ← 0
for i = 1 to N do
    if i == u then
        weight ← (λ_forget * n_i) / total_weight
    else
        weight ← n_i / total_weight
    end if
    θ_g ← θ_g + weight * θ_i
end for

return θ_g
```

#### 3.2.3 Complete FedForget Algorithm

**Algorithm 3**: FedForget Main Algorithm

```
Input: Pre-trained model θ_g, clients {C_1, ..., C_N},
       unlearning client C_u, rounds R_unlearn,
       α, λ_neg, λ_forget, τ
Output: Unlearned model θ_g*

// Step 1: Register unlearning request
θ_A ← θ_g  // Fix Teacher A (global model)
θ_B ← θ_u  // Optional: Save local model as Teacher B

// Step 2: Unlearning rounds
for t = 1 to R_unlearn do
    // Broadcast global model
    for all clients C_i do
        θ_i ← θ_g
    end for

    // Client-side training
    for all clients C_i in parallel do
        if i == u then
            // Unlearning client
            θ_u ← UnlearningClientTrain(θ_u, θ_A, θ_B, D_u,
                                        α, λ_neg, τ)
        else
            // Regular client
            θ_i ← LocalTrain(θ_i, D_i)
        end if
    end for

    // Server-side aggregation
    θ_g ← FedForgetAggregate({θ_1, ..., θ_N}, {n_1, ..., n_N},
                             u, λ_forget, t)
end for

return θ_g*
```

### 3.3 Theoretical Analysis (Optional)

**Privacy Guarantee.** Under differential privacy framework, FedForget provides:

$$
\Pr[\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{D}) \in S] \leq e^\epsilon \Pr[\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{D}') \in S] + \delta
$$

where $\mathcal{D}'$ is the dataset after removing $\mathcal{D}_u$.

**Convergence.** The unlearning process converges when:

$$
\|\theta_g^t - \theta_{\text{retrain}}^*\| \leq \mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})
$$

where $\theta_{\text{retrain}}^*$ is the retrained model.

*(Note: Detailed proofs can be added based on specific assumptions)*

### 3.4 Design Choices and Rationale

**Why Dual-Teacher?**
- Teacher A preserves global knowledge from non-unlearning clients
- Teacher B (or gradient ascent) actively removes unlearning client's contribution
- Balance controlled by $\alpha$ allows flexible trade-off

**Why Dynamic Weight Adjustment?**
- Amplifies unlearning signal in global aggregation
- Faster convergence than standard FedAvg
- Minimal communication overhead (only parameter change)

**Why Knowledge Distillation?**
- Soft labels preserve nuanced knowledge better than hard labels
- Temperature $\tau$ controls knowledge transfer granularity
- Proven effective in model compression and transfer learning
